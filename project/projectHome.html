            <h2 class="question1">What is 4-H?</h2>
            <p class="answer1">
                4-H is a youth development program that helps young people develop healthy lifestyles, build character,
                and become responsible citizens. The program is run by the USDA and is available to youth ages 5 to 18.
                4-H programs help youth develop skills and aspirations. It helps prepare them for work and life. The 4
                H's in the emblem stand for head, heart, hands and health. The program focuses on how to use these
                things to better self and our community. The program offers many things clubs, camps, conferences, and
                there is an international exchange program.

            <h2 class="question2">What is Little Wood River Critter Ranchers?</h2>
            <p class="answer2">
                Little wood river critter ranchers are a new 4-H group. We are based out of Gooding, Idaho in Gooding
                County. We specialize in small animal projects mainly focusing on rabbits. We meet once a month from
                January to August. Durning club meetings we teach children about their respective projects. This can
                include care and feeding of their animal, preparing them to show at the fair in August, and record
                keeping. We also teach them about parliamentary procedure and how to run a meeting. The members of the
                club will have opportunities to hold different positions. For example: president, vice president and
                secretary. We also do a community service project once a year.
