                4-H is a youth development program that helps young people develop healthy lifestyles, build character, and become responsible citizens. The program is run by the USDA and is available to youth ages 5 to 18. 4-H programs help youth develop skills and aspirations. It helps prepare them for work and life.

            <h3 class="question2">What is Little Wood River Critter Ranchers?</h3>
            <p class="answer2">
                Little wood river critter ranchers are a new 4-H group. We are based out of Gooding, Idaho in Gooding County. We specialize in small animal projects mainly focusing on rabbits. We meet once a month from January to August. Durning club meetings we teach children about their respective projects. This can include care and feeding of their animal, preparing them to show at the fair in August, and record keeping. We also teach them about parliamentary procedure and how to run a meeting. The members of the club will have opportunities to hold different positions. For example: president, vice president and secretary. We also do a community service project once a year.
