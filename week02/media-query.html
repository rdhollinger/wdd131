            <h2>2 Nephi 1:5</h2>
            <p>But, said he, notwithstanding our afflictions, we have obtained a land of promise, a land which is choice above all other lands; a land which the Lord God hath covenanted with me should be a land for the inheritance of my seed. Yea, the Lord hath covenanted this land unto me, and to my children forever, and also all those who should be led out of other countries by the hand of the Lord.</p>

            <h2>3 Nephi 1:14</h2>
            <p>Behold, I come unto my own, to fulfil all things which I have made known unto the children of men from the foundation of the world, and to do the will, both of the Father and of the Sonâ€”of the Father because of me, and of the Son because of my flesh. And behold, the time is at hand, and this night shall the sign be given.</p>
